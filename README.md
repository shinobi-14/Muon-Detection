# Muon-Detection
Muon-Detection, an independent subsystem of Project STRIVE developed for the SDL Payload Challenge, serves as a payload on the sounding rocket Airavata in IREC 2025.

The Muon-Detection system incorporates a commercial and a student-designed 3D-printed scintillator to measure muon flux along the rocket's trajectory, enabling performance comparison and supporting real-time tomography simulations for potential non-destructive testing during sonic and supersonic flight.

## Detector Architecture
#### 1. Commercial Scintillator Setup
- Scintillator: BC-408 plastic scintillator (known for its high light yield and fast decay time)
- Photo-detector: 3mm Ã— 3mm BROADCOM SiPM (Silicon Photomultiplier)
- Associated Electronics

#### 2. Experimental 3D Printed Scintillator
- Developed in collaboration with IIT Roorkee, it explores the feasibility of using custom-fabricated materials for radiation detection.
- Coupled with identical SiPM and amplifiers, this enables direct performance comparison between the two scintillation methods.
