# Muon-Detection
Muon-Detection, an independent subsystem of Project STRIVE developed for the SDL Payload Challenge, serves as a payload on the sounding rocket Airavata in IREC 2025.

The Muon-Detection system incorporates a commercial and a student-designed 3D-printed scintillator (developed in collaboration with IIT Roorkee) to measure muon flux along the rocket's trajectory, enabling performance comparison and supporting real-time tomography simulations for potential non-destructive testing during sonic and supersonic flight.

- Scintillator: BC-408 plastic scintillator (known for its high light yield and fast decay time)
- Photo-detector: 3mm × 3mm BROADCOM SiPM (Silicon Photomultiplier)
- Associated Electronics

- Scintillation Components: Incorporated 2,5-diphenyloxazole (PPO) and a wavelength shifter.
- Scintillator Fabrication: Used an acrylate photo-curing monomer with aromatic rings as the base matrix.
- 3D Printing Process: Added a small amount of BAPO photo-initiator, poured the mixture into the 3D-printer VAT, and printed 100 µm layers sequentially (on top of each other) to form the final structure.
